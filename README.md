# Please take note

* You did not write the init and the 'possible' functions in the class.

Well, that's the only reason. I have made changes, and if you want to check what's the diffrence, please check class Employee as an 
example class and how I utilise the idea of class in the line 3 and 84.

I did not complete the task for you. You need to do this yourself. I hope you get the idea of classes. If not, leave it be and I'll try
to explain it by writing code in front of you. Then again, this is not that important, you can survive without OOP but it would be very 
useful to learn OOP. I want to see you make progress on Flask first. When you start reading how to use Flask, you will learn about OOP on
the fly, well, I hope so.
